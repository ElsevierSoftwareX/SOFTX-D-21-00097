# src
Run src/Main_menu/Main_menu.mlapp to start the toolbox. Once you will have added Iso2mesh (see documentation), you can also package the app (MATLAB 'APPS' ribbon / Package App / select Main_menu.mlapp) and then install it (MATLAB 'APPS' ribbon / Install App / select the app you just have created).

Most GUIs are coded with MATLAB app designer wich produces .mlapp files not readable with a text editor (except for MATLAB of course). Therefore, for each .mlapp file, its .m file equivalent (*_exported.m) is also present in the reposity so that you can see the modifications introduced by the commits (athough you do not need these *_exported.m files to run the app).
