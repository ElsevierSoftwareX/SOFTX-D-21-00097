Release version notes:

•	v0.91 (03/18/2021)
Generation module
- Added additive phase generation algorithm from Dr. Aashutosh N. Mistry, with documentation updated.
- Re-worked microstructure generation module (additive phase) GUI.
- Add new submodule: deterministic generation (incomplete).
- bug fixed: phase generation module dx, dy, dz diameters were assigned to wrong diameters.
- Volume fraction actualization fixed
Meshing module
- Mesh a unique microstructure, an half-cell, a full-cell (including the two current collectors, the two electrodes and the separator), or a polycrhistalline architecture.
- Add regular mesh generation option.
- GUI overhaul. Switched from programmatic GUI to MATLAB app design GUI.
Characterization module
- Connectivity calculation now also determine directional and oriented connectivity instead of only considering the largest cluster.
Visualization module
- Added checkerboard choice for comparison of segmented and grey level volumes.
- Switched from programmatic GUI to MATLAB app design GUI.
- Replace nanmax, nanmin with max, min to avoid need of Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox in src\Microstrucrure_and_results_visualisation\microstructure_visualization_GUI.m
Filtering and segmentation module
- Added arguments for adapthisteq in the GUI, with updated documentation and examples.
Miscellaneous
- Updated main menu.
- New function: Microstructure_basic_visualization_interface.m and Microstructure_comparison_visualization_interface.m in src\Miscellaneous, used to avoid recoding visualization each time only simple 2D slice view is required.
Documentation
- Added analytical expression of the corrective factor used in specific surface area (§VII-5di).
- Added section XI USEFUL STANDALONE FUNCTIONS to present some functions that can be used independently for some very common task (such as loading a tif file, saving MATLAB tables in csv files, etc.).
- Added short introduction text for the ‘About the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’ section.
- Added references for the ‘Getting started with microstructure analysis’ section.
