# MATBOX: Microstructure Analysis Toolbox documentation
**MATLAB open source microstructure analysis code embedded with a graphic user interface**\
*v0.9 06/29/2020*

**New version soon to be finished: expect to see a major update on meshing and generation. Release likely to be late February or March 2021. F. Usseglio-Viretta.**

MATBOX is a MATLAB application for performing various microstructure-related tasks including **microstructure numerical generation**, **image filtering** and **microstructure segmentation**, **microstructure characterization**, result **three-dimensional visualization** and **result correlation**, and **microstructure meshing**. \
MATBOX was originally developed to analyse electrode microstructures for lithium ion batteries; however, the algorithms provided by the toolbox are widely applicable to other heterogeneous materials.

The toolbox provides a user-friendly experience thanks to a **Graphic-User Interface** and requires no coding to be used.

Installation and instructions are detailed in the pdf documentation. \
Run src/Main_menu/Microstructure_analysis_toolbox_mainmenu.m to start the toolbox.
