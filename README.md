# MATBOX: Microstructure Analysis Toolbox documentation
**MATLAB open source microstructure analysis code embedded with a graphic user interface**\
*v0.91 March 18, 2021*\
 See release_notes.txt for a change log.

MATBOX is a MATLAB application for performing various microstructure-related tasks including **microstructure numerical generation**, **image filtering** and **microstructure segmentation**, **microstructure characterization**, result **three-dimensional visualization** and **result correlation**, and **microstructure meshing**. \
MATBOX was originally developed to analyse electrode microstructures for lithium ion batteries; however, the algorithms provided by the toolbox are widely applicable to other heterogeneous materials.

The toolbox provides a user-friendly experience thanks to a **Graphic-User Interface** and requires no coding to be used.

Installation and instructions are detailed in the pdf documentation. \
Run src/Main_menu/Main_menu.mlapp to start the toolbox (mlapp extension corresponds to MATLAB app created with app designer).

* MATBOX main menu and illustration of each module:

* MATBOX modules inputs/outputs:
The inputs for most modules are stack tiff files (which once imported in MATLAB a 3D array).

## What's next?
- Publish in a journal article is next priority.
- Next release will focus on properly finish the generation module, dust off the the characterization module, and add a template to the correlation module to make it faster for the user.
